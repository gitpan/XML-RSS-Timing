README for XML-RSS-Timing
                                        Time-stamp: "2004-01-24 22:12:37 AST"

RSS/RDF modules can use the skipHours, skipDays, ttl, and sy:update*
elements to express what days/times they won't update, so that RSS/RDF
clients can conserve network resources by not bothering to poll a feed
more than once during such a period.

This Perl module is for taking in the RSS/RDF skipHours, skipDays, ttl,
and sy:update* elements' values, and figuring out when they say new
content might be available.



INSTALLATION

You install XML::RSS::Timing et al, as you would install any Perl module
library, by running these commands:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

If you want to install a private copy of XML::RSS::Timing in your home
directory, then you should try to produce the initial Makefile with
something like this command:

  perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=~/perl

See "perldoc perlmodinstall" for more information and advice.



This module doesn't depend on XML::RSS, nor in fact have any
particular relationship with it.
